you will need nodejs installed then inside the git clone folder run in the terminal 'npm init" and then once you done filling out the form from npm init run 'npm i express fs", and then you should be good to go to run "node scrape" to run the program. and if there are some vocabulary errors in the about im sorry im only 12. And if you have any requests for projects email gbirdman263@gmail.com, im a pretty good nodejs developer.
